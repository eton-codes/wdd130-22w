        <p>I grew up in Japan! Currently a Software Engineering Major, wanting to work as a Software Engineer in the near future. This class is a part of the SE intro classes, so I would like to get the basics down on how to structure, and build a basic website.</p>
        <p> By the end of this semester, I want to design a functioning website that looks and works robust. So Iâ€™m here to learn the modern HTML and CSS use. Curious what makes a great website great. Ultimately helping me to build my portfolio website.</p>
